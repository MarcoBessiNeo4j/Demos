    "A Diagnosis-Treatment Combination (‘Diagnose Behandel Combinatie’, DBC healthcare product or DBC) is a code that describes the entire process of treatment under specialist medical healthcare. A DBC includes all the costs incurred by the healthcare provider to give you the right healthcare. So it also includes costs not directly related to your treatment. The rate for a DBC is based on an average of the costs incurred for a particular course of treatment. The start date of a DBC is the date of first contact with the healthcare provider and determines the reimbursement. The bill is settled on the DBC start date. If the commencement date for a DBC is outside of the term of your insurance, none of the costs associated with that DBC are covered. In addition to a DBC, a hospital may charge for treatments categorised as other healthcare products (‘overige zorgproducten’, OZP). These are often single treatments that are not associated with a course of treatment. For example, diagnostics requested by the general practitioner, such as an ultrasound or X-ray, or diagnostics for dental surgery. Specific expensive healthcare is also claimed under other healthcare products. Examples here include intensive care, expensive medicines and blood products.\n",

This agreement specifies your rights and obligations in respect of the medical aid you have on loan. You must return the medical aid upon termination of your insurance policy. We pay the reimbursement directly to the healthcare provider if you receive the medical aid on loan from a contracted healthcare provider. If you purchase a medical aid from a non-contracted healthcare provider and that aid would usually be provided on loan, you will not automatically be reimbursed for the full purchase value. We will reimburse you the costs involved in using the medical aid for an entire year in the same way as we reimburse these costs with a contracted healthcare provider. You do not need to pay any costs for medical aids on loan, so you do not pay a deductible for them. The deductible does apply, however, to the costs of consumables and usage associated with the medical aid that we lend you.\n",

Your general insurance policy covers admissions of up to 1095 (3 x 365) consecutive days. The following rules apply here: - if your admission is interrupted for less than 31 days, the number of days of the interruption do not count, but we will continue to count after the interruption to determine the total; - if your admission is interrupted for a period of more than 30 days, we start counting again from the beginning to determine the total; - if your admission is interrupted for weekend/holiday leave, the number of days of interruption counts towards the total number of days.\n",
